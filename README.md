# I2Q
In it to Quit 

This repo is for the I2Q data. First date we received data was 11/20/15. We have received weekly sheets of data since (as of 12/7/15)

A data map can be found at Dropbox\I2Q\08_Data.

All data and dofiles can be found on Dropbox: Dropbox\I2Q\08_Data. 

The process of cleaning and merging (as of 12/7/2015) is the following: 
1. import weekly sheets of data one at a time and reformat each one to prepare for merge
2. merge the data together
3. perform HFCs on the data 
4. clean the data
